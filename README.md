## The idea

Many terms used in matrix computations are named after individuals. The goal of this repository is to provide a series of suggestions for alternative phrases that are technically correct and perhaps more intuitive descriptions.

### Gaussian Elimination
Sequential variable elimination 

### Cholesky 
LLt factorization 

### Jordan Canonical Form
invariant subspace decomposition
: *Justification* 


## Boundary conditions

### Dirichlet boundaries
fixed value boundaries 

### Neumann boundaries
fixed derivative boundaries

## Iterative methods
