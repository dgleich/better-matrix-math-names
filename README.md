## The idea

Many terms used in matrix computations are named after individuals. The goal of this repository is to provide a series of suggestions for alternative phrases that are technically correct and perhaps more intuitive descriptions.

## Factorizations

### Gaussian Elimination
Sequential variable elimination 

### Cholesky 
LLt factorization 

### Jordan Canonical Form
invariant subspace decomposition
: *Justification* 

## Matrices

### Householder reflector
Just reflector will do nicely, or
single coordinate reflector.

## Boundary conditions

### Dirichlet boundaries
fixed value boundaries 

### Neumann boundaries
fixed derivative boundaries

## Iterative methods

### Gauss-Seidel
cyclical coordinate relax-and-solve

### MINRES
minimum residual method (for symmetric matrices) (no need!)

### GMRES
also great!
